## Introduction

AirGPT Backend is the server-side component of the AirGPT application. It provides a bridge between the frontend client and the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model, allowing users to make requests and receive responses.

## Installation

To set up the AirGPT Backend, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/omerBNB/airgpt-backend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd airgpt-backend
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using npm:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up the environment variables by creating a `.env` file and providing the necessary values. You can use the provided `.env.example` file as a template.

5. Start the server:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

6. The server should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`. You can configure the port in the `.env` file.

## Usage

To use the AirGPT Backend, you need to have the frontend client set up. The client can be found at [AirGPT Frontend](https://github.com/omerBNB/airgpt-frontend).

Once both the backend and frontend are running, you can access the AirGPT application in your browser.

## API Endpoints

The AirGPT Backend provides the following API endpoints:

- `POST /api/completions`: Sends a request to the GPT-3.5 model for text completion. The request payload should include the `prompt` and `maxTokens` fields.

For detailed information on how to use these endpoints, refer to the API documentation provided in the repository.
